# Project Description

In this project, a website tailored for faculty members teaching CAPSTONE project courses is developed. This website will feature a number of tools to aid faculty during the process of teaching these courses. The two most important tools are a timeslot picking tool, and a group messaging tool, which are discussed in what follows:

## Timeslot Picking Tool

This tool will allow faculty members to create a number of timeslots available for groups of students to pick their preferred meeting times. After the timeslots are created, students are able to log in and click on available timeslots. The tool should also message all group members with details about the chosen timeslots. Note that the tool does not have an option to allow students to change their option. This is done by design to ensure that students will discuss with their groups as soon as possible (as opposed to a student simply trying to keep a placeholder and discussing later).

# Group Messaging Tool
This tool will allow the faculty to quickly visualize all groups and its members. Moreover, this toll should allow facutly to quickly craft an email message to specific groups.

Note that both these tools require the website to have an authentication system in which users can take two different roles (faculty or student), each role with specific capabilities. Due to the fact that users are only allowed into the system as per faculty's invitation, no authentication APIs, such as Facebook, or Google, are implemented.
